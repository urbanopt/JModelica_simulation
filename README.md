# JModelica Simulation
GitHub repo for storing scripts related to simulation of Modelica models using JModelica. The initial focus is on simulation in HPC environments.

#Singularity Recipes
Recipes for building Singularity containers for compilation and simulation of Modelica models using PyModelica and PyFMI. Note that the recipe that would support compilation and simulation is for use with Python2 only, while a separate recipe supports simulation in Python3.
